# Session Handoff: Batch 1 Validation & Taxonomy Integration
**Date:** 2025-10-23  
**Production URL:** https://bookshelves-5f0vwgf45-john-dunhams-projects-39f6d8ce.vercel.app

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Database Cleanup & Batch 1 Loading
- ✅ Cleared old shelf data causing 404 errors
- ✅ Loaded all 10 batch 1 books into `books` table
- ✅ Created `book_stats` entries with simulated ratings for all 10 books
- ✅ Database now has clean state: 10 books, 10 stats, 0 user_books

### 2. Disabled Auto-Ingestion (Temporary)
**Modified:** `server/api-handlers/browse.ts`
- Commented out Google Books API auto-fetch in browse queries (lines 637-749)
- Disabled `ensureCatalogSeed()` that auto-loads 400+ books
- **Why:** Prevent random Google Books data from entering during batch 1-3 validation

### 3. Fixed Browse Endpoint
**Modified:** `server/api-handlers/browse.ts`
- Simplified SQL queries to only use `books` and `book_stats` tables
- Removed all references to taxonomy relationship tables that didn't exist yet
- Browse now returns batch 1 books correctly

### 4. Fixed API Routing Issues
**Deleted:** `api/index.ts` (catch-all handler blocking real endpoints)  
**Fixed:** `vercel.json` (removed rewrite rule blocking API routes)  
**Created:** `api/browse/index.ts` wrapper for browse handler

### 5. Disabled Works Endpoint (Temporary)
**Modified:** `client/src/pages/BrowsePage.tsx`
- Set `useWorksEndpoint = false` (line 77)
- Forces all browse queries to use `/api/browse` instead of `/api/works`

### 6. Created Stub API Endpoints
**Created:**
- `api/taxonomy-list/index.ts` - Returns empty arrays (now replaced with real implementation)
- `api/book-taxonomy/index.ts` - Returns empty taxonomy (now replaced with real implementation)
- `api/taxonomy-seed/index.ts` - Returns 503 (still stub)
- `api/ingest/index.ts` - Returns 503 (still stub)
- `api/book-stats/[googleBooksId]/index.ts` - Returns null stats (still stub)

### 7. Seeded Full Taxonomy System ✨
**Executed:** `node scripts/seed-taxonomy.js`
- ✅ 2 domains
- ✅ 34 supergenres
- ✅ 93 genres
- ✅ 456 subgenres
- ✅ 38 formats
- ✅ 7 age markets
- ✅ 324 cross tags
- ✅ All relationships (supergenre-domain, genre-domain, genre-supergenre, subgenre cross-attachments)

### 8. Applied Batch 001 Enrichments ✨
**Executed:** `node scripts/apply-batch-001-taxonomy.mjs`
- ✅ Linked all 10 batch 1 books to taxonomy
- ✅ Applied domains, supergenres, genres, subgenres
- ✅ Applied 20 cross-tags per book (200 total)
- ✅ Applied age markets

### 9. Enabled Real Taxonomy APIs ✨
**Replaced stubs with real implementations:**
- `api/taxonomy-list/index.ts` - Now queries database for all taxonomy
- `api/book-taxonomy/index.ts` - Now queries book's taxonomy relationships

## Current System State

### Database (Neon PostgreSQL)
```
Books: 10 (all from batch 001)
Book Stats: 10 (with simulated ratings)
User Books: 0 (shelves empty)
Taxonomy Tables: FULLY SEEDED
  - 93 genres, 456 subgenres, 324 tags, 7 audiences
Book-Taxonomy Links: COMPLETE for batch 001
  - All 10 books linked to genres/subgenres/tags
```

### What Works
- ✅ Browse page shows batch 1 books
- ✅ Can add/remove books from shelves
- ✅ Carousel filter editor opens and loads taxonomy data
- ✅ Tags, Formats, Block filters show data
- ✅ Domain and Supergenre filters show data
- ✅ Genre filter shows data

### Known UI Issues (Client-Side, Not API)

#### Issue 1: Domain/Supergenre Filter Clears Genres
**Problem:** When selecting Domain or Supergenre, the Genre dropdown becomes empty  
**Expected:** Genre dropdown should be filtered to show only genres that match the selected domain/supergenre  
**Location:** React component logic in carousel filter editor  
**Root Cause:** Client-side filtering logic not properly cascading

#### Issue 2: Genre Doesn't Show Subgenres
**Problem:** When selecting a Genre, no Subgenres appear in dropdown  
**Expected:** Subgenre dropdown should be filtered to show only subgenres under selected genre  
**Location:** React component logic in carousel filter editor  
**Root Cause:** Client-side filtering logic not using `genre_id` relationship

#### Issue 3: Book Cards Don't Show Taxonomy Chips
**Problem:** Book cards in browse/shelf views don't display clickable genre/tag chips  
**Expected:** Cards should show chips like "Romance | Billionaire CEO" that are clickable  
**Location:** `BookCard.tsx` and/or `BookDetailDialog.tsx`  
**Root Cause:** Components may not be fetching from `/api/book-taxonomy?googleBooksId=...`

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check if `BookCard` component fetches book taxonomy
2. Check browser network tab - is `/api/book-taxonomy` being called?
3. If called, check response - does it return genres/subgenres/tags?
4. If not called, component needs to fetch taxonomy data
5. Check if component has UI logic to render taxonomy chips

#### Issue 4: Audience May Be Missing (Minor)
**Status:** API returns 7 age markets as "audiences", need to verify UI displays them

## Process for Batch 2 (UPDATED)

### Prerequisites
Batch 2 books must already be enriched following the enrichment process:
- Books exported from database
- Summaries written (150-300 words)
- Taxonomy applied (genres, subgenres, 20 tags each)
- SQL generated in `enrichment_sql/BATCH_002_MASTER.sql`

### Steps to Load Batch 2

#### Step 1: Load Basic Book Data
```bash
node scripts/load-batch.mjs books_batch_002.json
```
This creates book records and book_stats entries.

#### Step 2: Apply Taxonomy Enrichments
Create `scripts/apply-batch-002-taxonomy.mjs` (copy from batch 001 version):
```javascript
// Update the bookFiles array to batch 002 UUIDs
const bookFiles = [
  // List all batch 002 UUID.sql files from enrichment_sql/
];
```

Then run:
```bash
node scripts/apply-batch-002-taxonomy.mjs
```

This links books to taxonomy (genres, subgenres, tags).

#### Step 3: Deploy (if needed)
If any code changes were made:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Load batch 002 with taxonomy"
git push origin main
npx vercel --prod
```

### Important Notes for Batch 2+
- ✅ Taxonomy tables are already seeded (don't run seed-taxonomy again)
- ✅ Browse queries work with taxonomy (already updated)
- ✅ APIs serve taxonomy (already updated)
- ⚠️ Auto-ingestion is still disabled (by design until batches 1-3 validated)

## Debugging Tasks for Next Session

### Priority 1: Fix UI Filtering Logic
**File:** Likely in `client/src/components/TaxonomyFilterV2.tsx` or similar
**Tasks:**
1. Find the component that handles Domain/Supergenre/Genre/Subgenre selection
2. Add console logging to see what happens when Domain is selected
3. Verify that Genre dropdown is being filtered, not cleared
4. Fix cascade logic: Domain → Supergenre → Genre → Subgenre

### Priority 2: Enable Book Card Taxonomy Chips
**Files:** `client/src/components/BookCard.tsx`, `BookDetailDialog.tsx`
**Tasks:**
1. Check if components fetch `/api/book-taxonomy?googleBooksId=...`
2. If not, add fetch call when book is displayed
3. Add UI rendering for taxonomy chips
4. Make chips clickable to filter/browse by that taxonomy

### Priority 3: Update Browse Queries (Optional)
**File:** `server/api-handlers/browse.ts`
**Task:** Re-enable taxonomy filtering in browse queries (currently simplified)
**Status:** Works without this, but would enable more sophisticated filtering

---

## Documentation That Needs Updating

### BATCH_1_STATUS.md
Should be rewritten to reflect:
- Taxonomy system is now ENABLED
- Batch 001 has full taxonomy relationships
- Process for loading batch 2+ with taxonomy

### BATCH_ENRICHMENT_MASTER.md
Should include:
- Step for running taxonomy seed (one time only)
- Step for applying enriched SQL after loading basic book data
- Note that taxonomy APIs are enabled

---

## Quick Reference Commands

### Check Database State
```bash
node scripts/diagnose-and-clean.mjs
```

### Check Specific Book
```bash
# Edit scripts/check-book.mjs to change google_books_id
node scripts/check-book.mjs
```

### Verify Taxonomy Count
```bash
node -e "const pg = require('pg'); const c = new pg.Client({connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL, ssl: {rejectUnauthorized: false}}); c.connect().then(() => c.query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM genres')).then(r => console.log('Genres:', r.rows[0].count)).finally(() => c.end())"
```

## Environment Info
- **Platform:** Windows 10/11 with PowerShell 5.1
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL (shared, no local DB)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Hobby plan, 11/12 serverless functions used)
- **Node Version:** v25.0.0

---

## Questions to Address Next Session
1. Should we re-enable auto-ingestion after batch 3 is validated?
2. Should we implement the manual ingestion trigger feature?
3. Do we need to update the browse queries to use taxonomy tables for better filtering?
4. Should book_stats be populated from real data or keep simulated ratings?

---

**Status:** ✅ Batch 001 data loaded with full taxonomy, APIs working, UI needs debugging for filtering and taxonomy display
