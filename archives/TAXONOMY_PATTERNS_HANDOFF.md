**Pattern Structure for Genres** (medium-high complexity):
```json
{
  "fantasy": {
    "name": "Fantasy",
    "description": "Fiction featuring magic, mythical creatures, and invented worlds",
    "parent_supergenre": "speculative-fiction",
    "parent_domain": "fiction",
    
    "core_elements": {
      "magic_system": [...],
      "fantastical_creatures": [...],
      "settings": [...]
    },
    
    "typical_tropes": [...],
    "plot_patterns": [...],
    "character_archetypes": [...],
    "subgenres": [...],
    "strong_signals": [...],
    "avoid_confusion_with": {...},
    "minimum_confidence": 0.65
  }
}
```

### Priority 2: Complete Supergenres (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**File**: `supergenre_patterns.json` (update existing)  
**Target**: Add remaining 14 supergenres  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Token Budget**: ~15-20k tokens

**Remaining 14 Supergenres**:
- adventure-action
- family-domestic
- inspirational-religious-fiction
- western-frontier

- environment-nature
- essays-criticism
- food-drink
- home-hobbies
- pets-animals
- reference-education
- sports-recreation
- travel-adventure
- humor-satire (listed but not created in Phase 1)

### Priority 3: Pattern Testing (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Action**: Test existing patterns against real book summaries  
**Target**: 50-100 books from enrichment_data/  
**Purpose**: Validate pattern quality before expanding further  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

**Testing Process**:
1. Load 50-100 book summaries from enrichment_data/
2. Run domain pattern matching → record results
3. Run supergenre pattern matching → record results
4. Compare to any existing manual tags (if available)
5. Calculate precision/recall/F1 scores
6. Document false positives/negatives
7. Refine patterns based on results

### Priority 4: Subgenre Patterns (FUTURE)
**File**: `subgenre_patterns.json` (not yet created)  
**Target**: Top 50 most common subgenres  
**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours  
**Token Budget**: ~30-40k tokens

**Defer until**:
- Genres are complete (or at least top 30 done)
- Pattern testing validates current approach
- Confidence in pattern quality is high

## Key Architecture Points for Next Session

### 1. Hierarchical Matching is Mandatory
**Always match in this order**:
1. Domain (fiction/non-fiction/poetry/drama)
2. Supergenre (filtered by domain)
3. Genre (filtered by supergenre)
4. Subgenre (filtered by genre)
5. Cross-tags (no filtering)

**Why**: Prevents invalid combinations (e.g., "fantasy" genre can't be assigned to "non-fiction" domain)

### 2. Confidence Thresholds are Calibrated
- **Domains**: 0.75-0.80 (highest stakes)
- **Supergenres**: 0.65-0.75
- **Genres**: 0.60-0.70
- **Subgenres**: 0.55-0.65
- **Cross-tags**: 0.50-0.60

**Why**: Higher taxonomy levels require higher confidence to prevent cascading errors

### 3. Pattern Complexity Matches Stakes
- **Domains/Supergenres**: Multi-factor weighted scoring
- **Genres**: Core elements + indicators
- **Subgenres/Cross-tags**: Direct pattern matching

**Why**: More sophisticated matching at higher levels justifies computational cost

### 4. Exclusion Rules are Critical
Every pattern includes `exclusion_rules` to prevent false positives:
```json
"exclusion_rules": {
  "science_fiction": ["fictional technology"],
  "business": ["business strategy"]
}
```

**Why**: Many genres share keywords but have different contexts

### 5. Genre Families Create Relationships
Supergenres define which genres are valid children:
```json
{
  "speculative-fiction": {
    "genre_family": ["fantasy", "science-fiction", "horror", "dystopian-fiction"]
  }
}
```

**Why**: Enables filtering and validation during matching

## Pattern Quality Checklist

Before creating patterns, ensure:

- [ ] **Parent linking**: Every pattern links to parent taxonomy level
- [ ] **Core elements**: 3-5 groups of defining characteristics
- [ ] **Strong indicators**: 10-15 high-signal keywords/phrases
- [ ] **Pattern variety**: Multiple pattern types (exact, synonyms, structural)
- [ ] **Exclusion rules**: Disambiguation from similar genres
- [ ] **Confidence threshold**: Appropriate for taxonomy level
- [ ] **Examples**: Consider edge cases and genre-bending books
- [ ] **Subgenre awareness**: Know which subgenres belong to this genre

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't use single-word patterns** - Too broad, high false positive rate
   - ❌ Bad: "magic"
   - ✅ Good: "magic system", "magical powers", "learns magic"

2. **Don't skip exclusion rules** - Genres often share keywords
   - ❌ Bad: "fantasy" pattern without excluding "science fantasy"
   - ✅ Good: Explicit exclusion of sci-fi technology indicators

3. **Don't forget parent validation** - Genres must match their supergenre
   - ❌ Bad: Assigning "fantasy" without first confirming "speculative-fiction"
   - ✅ Good: Hierarchical matching with validation

4. **Don't over-fit to one book** - Patterns should generalize
   - ❌ Bad: "Harry Potter" as exact phrase for "magic-school"
   - ✅ Good: "school for magic", "magical academy", "learns spells"

5. **Don't ignore confidence calibration** - Test and adjust thresholds
   - ❌ Bad: Using 0.5 confidence for domain classification
   - ✅ Good: 0.75+ for domains, validated against test set

---

## Testing Strategy for Next Session

### Step 1: Prepare Test Data
```javascript
// Load 50-100 book summaries
const testBooks = loadBooksFrom('enrichment_data/*.json');

// Filter to books with varied genres
const testSet = selectDiverseBooks(testBooks, {
  fiction: 30,
  nonFiction: 20,
  edgeCases: 10  // Genre-bending, ambiguous
});
```

### Step 2: Run Pattern Matching
```javascript
for (const book of testSet) {
  const domain = matchDomain(book.summary);
  const supergenres = matchSupergenres(book.summary, domain);
  const genres = matchGenres(book.summary, supergenres);
  
  // Record results
  logMatch(book.id, { domain, supergenres, genres });
}
```

### Step 3: Evaluate Results
```javascript
// Calculate metrics
const metrics = calculateMetrics(results, manualTags);

// Identify problem patterns
const falsePositives = findFalsePositives(results);
const falseNegatives = findFalseNegatives(results);

// Generate refinement suggestions
suggestPatternImprovements(falsePositives, falseNegatives);
```

### Step 4: Refine Patterns
- Adjust confidence thresholds if needed
- Add exclusion rules for common false positives
- Expand pattern sets for missed matches
- Re-test after refinements

## Token Budget Management

**Current Usage**: ~127k / 200k (63%)  
**Remaining**: ~73k tokens

**Recommended Allocation for Next Session**:
- Genre patterns (30): ~40k tokens
- Supergenre completion (14): ~15k tokens
- Testing and validation: ~8k tokens
- Documentation updates: ~5k tokens
- Buffer: ~5k tokens
- **Total**: ~73k tokens (within budget)

**If you run low on tokens**:
1. Prioritize genre patterns over supergenre completion
2. Create genres in batches: Top 15 → Commit → Top 15 more
3. Defer testing to subsequent session if necessary
4. Keep documentation concise

---

## Quick Start for Next Session

```bash
# 1. Review progress
cat TAXONOMY_PATTERNS_PROGRESS.md

# 2. Check current pattern counts
wc -l domain_patterns.json supergenre_patterns.json cross_tag_patterns_v1.json

# 3. Read taxonomy for genre list
cat bookshelves_complete_taxonomy.json | grep -A 5 '"genres"'

# 4. Start creating genre_patterns.json
# Use domain_patterns.json and supergenre_patterns.json as templates

# 5. Test patterns (if time allows)
node test_patterns.js --domains --supergenres --genres

# 6. Commit progress
git add genre_patterns.json
git commit -m "feat: Add genre patterns (phase 1 - top 30 genres)"
```

## Questions to Consider

1. **Should genres have subgenre validation?**
   - Pro: Ensures consistency (genre must have at least one matching subgenre)
   - Con: Adds complexity, may be premature
   - **Recommendation**: Defer until subgenres are created

2. **Should we create a pattern validation tool?**
   - Pro: Catches errors early, ensures consistency
   - Con: Takes time away from pattern creation
   - **Recommendation**: Simple validation script after 50+ genres created

3. **Should cross-tags be expanded before genres?**
   - Pro: Cross-tags are easier to create
   - Con: Genres are higher priority for taxonomy matching
   - **Recommendation**: Complete genres first, then expand cross-tags to 1,000

---

## Success Criteria for Next Session

✅ **Minimum Success**:
- Create genre_patterns.json with top 20 genres
- Test patterns against 20-30 sample books
- Document any issues found

✅ **Target Success**:
- Create genre_patterns.json with top 30 genres
- Complete supergenre_patterns.json (remaining 14)
- Test patterns against 50 sample books
- Calculate precision/recall metrics

✅ **Stretch Success**:
- Create all 101 genre patterns
- Build automated pattern validation tool
- Start subgenre_patterns.json with top 20 subgenres

---

## Final Notes

**Pattern Creation is an Iterative Process**:
- First pass: Get patterns down, don't over-optimize
- Second pass: Test against real books
- Third pass: Refine based on false positives/negatives
- Fourth pass: Optimize confidence thresholds

**Quality > Quantity**:
- 30 excellent genre patterns > 101 mediocre patterns
- Better to have robust patterns for common genres
- Can always add more patterns later

**Documentation Matters**:
- Update TAXONOMY_PATTERNS_PROGRESS.md after each major milestone
- Note any architectural decisions or pattern insights
- Keep handoff docs current for future sessions
