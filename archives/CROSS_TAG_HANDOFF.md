## üìù Pattern Structure Reference

Each pattern must include:

```json
{
  "pattern-slug": {
    "exact": ["exact phrase 1", "exact phrase 2", "exact phrase 3"],
    "synonyms": ["synonym1", "synonym2", "synonym3", "synonym4", "synonym5"],
    "phrases": ["contextual phrase 1", "contextual phrase 2", "contextual phrase 3"],
    "avoid": ["false positive phrase 1", "false positive phrase 2"],
    "confidence_boost": 0.1,
    "notes": "Brief description of pattern usage"
  }
}
```

### Requirements:
- **exact:** 3-5 exact phrase matches
- **synonyms:** 5-10 alternative terms
- **phrases:** 3-7 contextual phrases (how readers/reviewers describe it)
- **avoid:** 2-5 false positive prevention phrases
- **confidence_boost:** 0.0-0.2 (higher for unambiguous, lower for generic)
- **notes:** Human-readable description

---

## üîÑ Workflow for Next Session

### Step 1: Read Context
```bash
# Read these files first:
- C:\Users\johnd\Bookshelves\CROSS_TAG_HANDOFF.md (this file)
- C:\Users\johnd\Bookshelves\CROSS_TAG_PATTERNS_PROGRESS.md
- C:\Users\johnd\Bookshelves\bookshelves_complete_taxonomy.json
```

### Step 2: Create Next Batch
```bash
# Create: cross_tag_patterns_batch_04.json (100 patterns)
# Focus: Settings & atmosphere (see recommendations above)
```

### Step 3: Update Progress Log
```bash
# Update: CROSS_TAG_PATTERNS_PROGRESS.md
# Add batch 4 info, update cumulative total (505)
```

### Step 4: Continue or Commit
- If token budget allows: Create batch 5, 6, etc.
- If approaching token limit: Update handoff doc and commit
- Target: Create batches until 500-1000 patterns complete

### Step 5: Final Merge (when complete)
When all batches are done (500-1000 patterns):
1. Merge all batch JSON files into single `cross_tag_patterns_complete.json`
2. Run validation (check JSON syntax, no duplicate slugs)
3. Update progress log with final statistics
4. Commit final merged file

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Current Progress:
- **Patterns created:** 405 / 1000 target (40.5%)
- **Batches completed:** 3
- **Coverage:** ~15% of 2,733 total cross-tags
- **Quality:** All patterns validated with comprehensive fields

### Final Goal:
- **Target patterns:** 500-1000 (high-priority tags)
- **Coverage aim:** Top 20-40% of most common/popular cross-tags
- **Quality standard:** All patterns include natural language matching + false positive prevention
- **Integration ready:** Valid JSON, matches schema, ready for task-08 enrichment pipeline

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Pattern Quality Over Quantity:** Better to have 500 excellent patterns than 1000 mediocre ones
2. **Natural Language Focus:** Patterns should match how real readers/reviewers describe books
3. **False Positive Prevention:** Always include "avoid" patterns for ambiguous terms
4. **Confidence Tuning:** Generic terms get 0.0-0.1 boost, specific terms get 0.15-0.2
5. **Batch Strategy:** Separate batch files prevent massive single-file edits, easier to manage
6. **Token Management:** Commit every 3-4 batches to avoid token limits

# Stage files
git add cross_tag_patterns*.json CROSS_TAG_PATTERNS_PROGRESS.md CROSS_TAG_HANDOFF.md

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: add cross-tag patterns batch 1-3 (405 patterns total)"

# Push
git push origin main
```

### Validation:
```powershell
# Check JSON syntax (PowerShell)
Get-Content cross_tag_patterns_batch_03.json | ConvertFrom-Json

## üöÄ Ready to Continue

This session created **405 high-quality patterns** across 3 batches. The foundation is solid. Next session should:

1. ‚úÖ Commit current work (3 batch files)
2. ‚úÖ Continue with Batch 4 (settings/atmosphere)
3. ‚úÖ Continue with Batch 5 (characters/relationships)
4. ‚úÖ Continue with Batch 6+ until 500-1000 target reached
5. ‚úÖ Merge all batches into final comprehensive file
6. ‚úÖ Validate and integrate into enrichment pipeline

**Estimated remaining work:** 2-3 more agent sessions (with fresh token budgets) to reach 500-1000 patterns.

---

**Session End Status:** Ready to commit. Continue in new session with fresh token budget.
