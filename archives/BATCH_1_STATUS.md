# Batch 1 Status Report

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Cleared Old Shelf Data
- Removed 1 orphaned user_book entry that was causing 404 errors
- Database is now clean with no shelf entries

### 2. ✅ Properly Loaded Batch 1 Books
- Loaded all 10 books from `books_batch_001.json` into the `books` table
- Created `book_stats` entries for all 10 books with simulated ratings (60-95/100) and rating counts (50-550)
- All books now have proper data for "Most Popular" and other carousels

### 3. ✅ Disabled Auto-Ingestion from Google Books
**Changed in `server/api-handlers/browse.ts`:**
- Temporarily commented out all "top up" logic that fetches from Google Books API
- Temporarily disabled `ensureCatalogSeed()` which auto-seeds 400+ books
- This prevents infinite scroll from pulling in random Google Books data

**Why:** We need to verify batch 1-3 data first before allowing automatic ingestion.

## Current Database State

```
Total books: 10 (all from batch 1)
Total book_stats: 10 (all have ratings/stats)
Total user_books: 0 (shelves are empty - ready for testing)
```

## Books in Batch 1

1. (Eco)Anxiety in Nuclear Holocaust Fiction and Climate Fiction
2. Summer of Lovecraft: Cosmic Horror in the 1960s
3. Blue-Green Rehabilitation
4. Justice in Young Adult Speculative Fiction
5. The Complete Nebula Award-winning Fiction
6. The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue
7. The Fantasy and Necessity of Solidarity
8. When I'm Gone
9. Nebula Award Stories Five
10. Science Fiction

## What You Should See Now

### Browse Screen
- **Most Popular carousel**: Should now show batch 1 books (they have stats!)
- **Other carousels**: Will show batch 1 books only
- **Infinite scroll**: Will stop after showing all 10 books (no more Google Books fetching)

### Shelves Screen
- Empty (no books on shelves yet)
- No 404 errors when clicking remove (old shelf data cleared)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
1. Hard reload the app to clear cache
2. Check Browse screen - all carousels should show batch 1 books
3. Add some batch 1 books to shelves to test shelf functionality
4. Verify infinite scroll stops gracefully after 10 books

### Before Batch 2
1. Verify all batch 1 books display correctly
2. Test that you can add/remove books from shelves without errors
3. Confirm ratings and stats are working properly

### When Ready for Batch 2 & 3
1. Create `books_batch_002.json` and `books_batch_003.json` following the same format as batch 1
2. Run the generic batch loader:
   ```bash
   node scripts/load-batch.mjs books_batch_002.json
   node scripts/load-batch.mjs books_batch_003.json
   ```
3. After all 3 batches are verified, we can:
   - Re-enable the auto-ingestion in `server/api-handlers/browse.ts`
   - Implement manual ingestion trigger (user-initiated)

### Future: Manual Ingestion Feature
Once batches 1-3 are stable, we can add:
- A button in the UI to "Load More Books"
- User can trigger ingestion on-demand when they want to expand the catalog
- This gives you control over when new books enter the system

## Files Changed

1. **Created:**
   - `scripts/diagnose-and-clean.mjs` - Database diagnostic and cleanup tool
   - `scripts/load-batch-1.mjs` - Batch loader with book_stats generation

2. **Modified:**
   - `server/api-handlers/browse.ts` - Disabled Google Books auto-fetching (lines 637-749, 1817-1824)

## Reverting Changes (If Needed)

To re-enable auto-ingestion from Google Books:
1. Open `server/api-handlers/browse.ts`
2. Uncomment lines 637-749 (the four "top up" sections)
3. Uncomment line 1824 (`await ensureCatalogSeed(sql);`)

## Notes

- The database is hosted on Neon (PostgreSQL)
- All changes are reversible
- Batch 1 data is preserved in `books_batch_001.json`
- No production data was affected (this is a development/demo database)
