# Publication Dating System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the complete implementation of the FRBR-lite publication dating system for Bookshelves. The system enables tracking multiple editions, movie/TV tie-ins, reissues, and proper publication date management.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`shared/schema.ts`)

Three new tables added:

- **`works`**: Intellectual work grouping (e.g., "Dune by Frank Herbert")
  - Stores computed dates for fast querying
  - Links to display edition for cover/metadata
  - Supports series relationships
  - Includes deduplication confidence scoring

- **`editions`**: Specific publications (format/language/market)
  - Links to parent work
  - Tracks ISBNs, Google Books IDs
  - Stores format, publication date, edition statements
  - References legacy `books` table for migration tracking

- **`release_events`**: Date-specific publication moments
  - Event types: ORIGINAL_RELEASE, FORMAT_FIRST_RELEASE, MAJOR_REISSUE_PROMO, NEW_TRANSLATION, MINOR_REPRINT, SPECIAL_EDITION, REVISED_EXPANDED
  - `isMajor` flag determines "Recently Released" inclusion
  - `promoStrength` (0-100) ranks events

### 2. Utility Functions (`server/lib/editions-utils.ts`)

- **`parsePublishedDate()`**: Handles Google Books date formats ("2024", "2024-03", "2024-03-15", "circa 2020")
- **`normalizeTitle()`**: Fuzzy title matching (removes articles, punctuation)
- **`extractSeriesInfo()`**: Detects series numbers ("Book 1", "#2", etc.)
- **`detectEventType()`**: Auto-classifies editions (movie tie-ins, anniversaries, etc.)
- **`updateWorkDates()`**: Recalculates computed date fields
- **`calculateMatchScore()`**: Fuzzy matching for deduplication (0-100 score)

### 3. API Functions (`server/lib/editions-api.ts`)

- **`createWorkFromBook()`**: Dual-write strategy for book ingestion
- **`browseWorks()`**: Query works with filtering and sorting
- **`getWorkEditions()`**: Fetch all editions for a work
- **`getWorkDetails()`**: Get work with full edition/event history
- **`addEditionToWork()`**: Manually add new editions

### 4. Migration Scripts (`scripts/migrate-editions.ts`)

- **Phase 1**: Backfill works/editions from existing books table
- **Phase 2**: Deduplicate works using fuzzy matching
- **Phase 3**: Enrich edition formats from categories

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Push Schema Changes

```bash
npm run db:push
```

This creates the three new tables in your Neon production database. **Existing tables remain untouched.**

### Step 2: Run Migration Script

```bash
npx tsx scripts/migrate-editions.ts
```

**What this does:**
1. Creates one `work` and one `edition` per existing `books` record
2. Parses publication dates from text strings
3. Creates ORIGINAL_RELEASE events for dated books
4. Groups works by normalized title
5. Merges duplicates with ≥70% match confidence
6. Detects formats from categories

**Safety:**
- Runs in batches of 100 to avoid long transactions
- Logs progress every 50 books
- Catches and logs errors without stopping
- Uses `legacyBookId` link to preserve traceability

### Step 3: Update Ingestion Endpoint

Modify `server/routes.ts` or `api/ingest.ts` to call `createWorkFromBook()` after creating a book:

```typescript
import { createWorkFromBook } from "./lib/editions-api";

// After creating book
const book = await storage.createBook(bookData);

// Also create work/edition (dual-write)
await createWorkFromBook({
  id: book.id,
  title: book.title,
  authors: book.authors,
  description: book.description,
  publishedDate: book.publishedDate,
  isbn: book.isbn,
  coverUrl: book.coverUrl,
  googleBooksId: book.googleBooksId,
  pageCount: book.pageCount,
  categories: book.categories,
});
```

### Step 4: Add Works Browsing Routes

Add to `server/routes.ts`:

```typescript
import { browseWorks, getWorkDetails, getWorkEditions } from "./lib/editions-api";

// Browse works (replaces old books browse eventually)
app.get("/api/works/browse", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const sort = req.query.sort as "original" | "latestMajor" | "latestAny" | "title" | undefined;
    const recentDays = req.query.recentDays ? parseInt(req.query.recentDays as string) : 90;
    const userId = req.query.userId as string | undefined;
    const limit = req.query.limit ? parseInt(req.query.limit as string) : 50;
    const offset = req.query.offset ? parseInt(req.query.offset as string) : 0;
    
    // Get user's book IDs to exclude
    let excludeUserBookIds: string[] = [];
    if (userId) {
      const userBooks = await storage.getUserBooks(userId);
      excludeUserBookIds = userBooks.map(ub => ub.bookId);
    }
    
    const works = await browseWorks({
      sort,
      recentDays,
      excludeUserBookIds,
      limit,
      offset,
    });
    
    res.json(works);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Browse works error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to browse works" });
  }
});

// Get work details with editions
app.get("/api/works/:id", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { id } = req.params;
    const work = await getWorkDetails(id);
    
    if (!work) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: "Work not found" });
    }
    
    res.json(work);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Get work error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to get work" });
  }
});

// Get all editions for a work
app.get("/api/works/:id/editions", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { id } = req.params;
    const editions = await getWorkEditions(id);
    res.json(editions);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Get editions error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to get editions" });
  }
});
```

### Step 5: Frontend Integration (Optional Initial Phase)

Keep existing browse page using `books` table initially. Add a feature flag:

```typescript
// In config or environment
const USE_WORKS_MODEL = process.env.VITE_USE_WORKS_MODEL === "true";

// In BrowsePage.tsx
const browseEndpoint = USE_WORKS_MODEL ? "/api/works/browse" : "/api/books/browse";
```

Gradually migrate components to use works-based data.

## Key Features

### Recently Released Detection

**Problem Solved:** Dune (1965) with 2021 movie tie-in should appear as "recent"

**Solution:**
- Create MAJOR_REISSUE_PROMO event for 2021 tie-in edition
- Set `isMajor=true` and `promoStrength=85`
- Work's `latestMajorReleaseDate` updates to 2021
- Browse with `sort=latestMajor` shows it in "Recently Released"

**Example:**
```typescript
// Add 2021 Dune movie tie-in
await addEditionToWork(
  duneWorkId,
  {
    format: "paperback",
    publicationDate: new Date("2021-10-15"),
    editionStatement: "Movie Tie-In Edition",
    coverUrl: "https://example.com/dune-2021-cover.jpg",
  },
  "MAJOR_REISSUE_PROMO",
  85 // High promo strength
);
```

### Edition Deduplication

**Problem Solved:** 20 editions of Dune clutter carousels

**Solution:**
- Migration script merges works with ≥70% match score
- Match score considers: title (40pts), author (30pts), ISBN (20pts)
- Series-aware: "Wheel of Time Book 1" ≠ "Wheel of Time Book 2"
- Manual override via `isManuallyConfirmed` flag

**Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Title: 40 points
if (normalizeTitle(a.title) === normalizeTitle(b.title)) score += 40;

// Author: 30 points
if (a.authors[0] === b.authors[0]) score += 30;

// ISBN: 20 points
if (isbnPrefix(a.isbn) === isbnPrefix(b.isbn)) score += 20;

// Merge if score >= 70
```

### User Cover Selection

**Frontend Flow:**
1. User clicks work card → sees primary cover
2. Clicks "Other Editions" icon
3. Modal shows all editions with covers
4. User selects preferred cover
5. Update work's `displayEditionId` for that user (future: user preferences table)

**API Call:**
```typescript
// Get all editions
const editions = await fetch(`/api/works/${workId}/editions`);

// Display covers, let user pick
// Update display edition (admin) or user preference (future)
```

### Format-First Releases

**Problem Solved:** First audiobook of old book should show as "recent"

**Solution:**
- Detect first occurrence of each format per work
- Create FORMAT_FIRST_RELEASE event with `isMajor=true`
- Appears in "Recently Released" even if book is old

**Example:**
```typescript
// 2023 audiobook of 1990 book
await addEditionToWork(
  workId,
  {
    format: "audiobook",
    publicationDate: new Date("2023-06-01"),
  },
  "FORMAT_FIRST_RELEASE",
  70 // Major event
);
```

## Event Classification Rules

| Event Type | Description | isMajor | Promo Strength | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|----------------|---------|
| ORIGINAL_RELEASE | First publication anywhere | ✅ | 100 | 1965 Dune hardcover |
| FORMAT_FIRST_RELEASE | First in new format | ✅ | 70 | First audiobook |
| MAJOR_REISSUE_PROMO | Movie/TV tie-in, anniversary | ✅ | 80-100 | 2021 Dune tie-in |
| NEW_TRANSLATION | First in new language | ✅ | 60 | Spanish edition |
| REVISED_EXPANDED | Substantive content changes | ✅ | 60 | Annotated edition |
| SPECIAL_EDITION | Collector's, deluxe | ❌* | 40 | Leather-bound |
| MINOR_REPRINT | Cover refresh only | ❌ | 10 | New cover design |

*Special editions become major if `promoStrength ≥ 60`

## Testing the Implementation

### Test Scenario 1: Dune (1965 + 2021 Tie-In)

```bash
# After migration, find Dune work
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM works WHERE title ILIKE '%dune%' LIMIT 1;"

# Add 2021 tie-in
npx tsx -e "
import { addEditionToWork } from './server/lib/editions-api';
await addEditionToWork(
  'WORK_ID_HERE',
  {
    format: 'paperback',
    publicationDate: new Date('2021-10-15'),
    editionStatement: 'Movie Tie-In',
    coverUrl: 'https://example.com/dune-2021.jpg',
  },
  'MAJOR_REISSUE_PROMO',
  90
);
"

# Query recently released
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/works/browse?sort=latestMajor&recentDays=365"
# Should include Dune with latestMajorReleaseDate = 2021-10-15
```

### Test Scenario 2: Wheel of Time Deduplication

```bash
# After migration, check for duplicate WoT works
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT title, COUNT(*) 
  FROM works 
  WHERE title ILIKE '%wheel of time%' 
  GROUP BY title 
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
"

# Should show merged works (few duplicates remain)
```

### Test Scenario 3: Format Detection

```bash
# Check format enrichment
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT format, COUNT(*) 
  FROM editions 
  GROUP BY format 
  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
"

# Should show: audiobook, ebook, paperback, hardcover, unknown
```

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes

All critical query paths are indexed:
- `works.latestMajorReleaseDate` → "Recently Released" queries
- `works.originalPublicationDate` → "Original Publication" sort
- `editions.workId` → Fast join for cover URLs
- `releaseEvents.editionId` → Event lookups

### Query Patterns

**Fast** ✅ (Uses computed fields):
```sql
SELECT * FROM works 
WHERE latest_major_release_date >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY latest_major_release_date DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Slow** ❌ (Needs aggregation):
```sql
SELECT w.*, MAX(re.event_date) 
FROM works w
JOIN editions e ON e.work_id = w.id
JOIN release_events re ON re.edition_id = e.id
WHERE re.is_major = true
GROUP BY w.id
ORDER BY MAX(re.event_date) DESC;
```

### Migration Performance

- **Phase 1 (Backfill)**: ~2-3 seconds per 100 books
- **Phase 2 (Dedupe)**: ~5-10 seconds per 100 works (depends on cluster size)
- **Phase 3 (Enrich)**: ~1 second per 100 editions

**Estimated total**: 5-10 minutes for 10,000 books

## Rollback Strategy

### If Migration Fails

```sql
-- Drop new tables (CASCADE removes all relations)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS release_events CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS editions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS works CASCADE;

-- App continues working with books table
```

### If Deduplication Is Wrong

```sql
-- Find incorrectly merged works
SELECT * FROM works WHERE match_confidence < 80 AND NOT is_manually_confirmed;

-- Manual split: create new work, move editions
INSERT INTO works (title, authors, ...) VALUES (...);
UPDATE editions SET work_id = 'NEW_WORK_ID' WHERE id IN (...);
```

### If Computed Dates Are Stale

```bash
# Recalculate all work dates
npx tsx -e "
import { db } from './db/index';
import { works } from '@shared/schema';
import { updateWorkDates } from './server/lib/editions-utils';

const allWorks = await db.select({ id: works.id }).from(works);
for (const work of allWorks) {
  await updateWorkDates(work.id);
  console.log(\`Updated \${work.id}\`);
}
"
```

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add `/api/works/browse` route

### Phase 2 (Short-term)
- [ ] Frontend: Edition browsing modal
- [ ] Frontend: Switch browse to works endpoint
- [ ] Admin: Manual edition management UI
- [ ] Admin: Merge/split works tool

### Phase 3 (Long-term)
- [ ] User-specific cover preferences
- [ ] Publication history timeline UI
- [ ] Series page with proper ordering
- [ ] Upcoming releases calendar

## Troubleshooting

### "TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined"

**Cause:** Work or edition missing after migration

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check for orphaned editions
SELECT e.* FROM editions e 
LEFT JOIN works w ON e.work_id = w.id 
WHERE w.id IS NULL;

-- Check for works without display edition
SELECT * FROM works WHERE display_edition_id IS NULL;
```

### "Recently Released" Shows No Results

**Cause:** `latestMajorReleaseDate` not populated

**Fix:**
```bash
# Recalculate work dates
npx tsx scripts/recalculate-work-dates.ts
```

### Deduplication Merged Wrong Books

**Cause:** Match threshold too low or series numbers not detected

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Mark as manually confirmed to prevent re-merge
UPDATE works SET is_manually_confirmed = true WHERE id = 'WORK_ID';

-- Split: move editions to new work
INSERT INTO works (...) VALUES (...) RETURNING id;
UPDATE editions SET work_id = 'NEW_WORK_ID' WHERE id IN (...);
```
