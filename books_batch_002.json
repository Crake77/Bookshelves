Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. When The Two Rivers is attacked by Trollocs-- a savage tribe of half-men, half-beasts-- five villagers flee that night into a world they barely imagined. They find new dangers waiting in the shadows and in the light. Rand al'Thor, an orphan, does not know that he is bound to the Wheel of Time-- and there are prophecies to be fulfilled. -- adapted from jacket",

A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.<br><br>Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. <br><br>Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.<br><br>Orson Scott Card's<i> Ender's Game</i> is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.<br><br>THE ENDER UNIVERSE<br><br>Ender series<br><i>Ender’s Game</i> /<i> Ender in Exile </i>/ <i>Speaker for the Dead </i>/ <i>Xenocide </i>/ <i>Children of the Mind</i><br><br>Ender’s Shadow series<br><i>Ender’s Shadow </i>/ <i>Shadow of the Hegemon </i>/ <i>Shadow Puppets </i>/ <i>Shadow of the Giant </i>/ <i>Shadows in Flight</i><br><br><i>Children of the Fleet</i><br><br>The First Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)<br><i>Earth Unaware </i>/ <i>Earth Afire </i>/ <i>Earth Awakens</i><br><br>The Second Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)<br><i>The Swarm </i>/<i>The Hive</i><br><br>Ender novellas<br><i>A War of Gifts </i>/<i>First Meetings</i></p>",

    "description": "Delve is an isekai litrpg that follows an average guy who just happened to wake up in a forest one day. He wasn’t summoned to defeat the demon lord or to save the world or anything like that, at least as far as he can tell. The only creature there to greet him was a regular old squirrel. Soon enough, he meets other people, only to discover that he can’t speak the language, and that not everybody immediately trusts random pajama-wearing strangers they met in the middle of the wilderness. Things generally go downhill from there, at least until the blue boxes start appearing. Delve is a story about finding your way in a new, strange, and dangerous world. It’s about avoiding death, figuring out what the heck is going on, and trying to make some friends along the way. It’s not about getting home, so much as finding a new one. Did I mention that there will be math?",
