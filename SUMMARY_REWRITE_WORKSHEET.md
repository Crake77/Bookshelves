The story follows Paul Atreides, whose family accepts control of Arrakis from the Emperor, placing them in a position of both great opportunity and extreme danger.

## 19. Delve (Path of the Deathless)

**Book ID:** `aafd33c5-f1ee-4da5-ae61-7df49eed6b0f`  
**Author:** SenescentSoul  
**ISBN:** N/A  

### Original Description (for reference only)

> Delve is an isekai litrpg that follows an average guy who just happened to wake up in a forest one day. He wasn't summoned to defeat the demon lord or to save the world or anything like that, at least as far as he can tell. The only creature there to greet him was a regular old squirrel. Soon enough, he meets other people, only to discover that he can't speak the language, and that not everybody immediately trusts random pajama-wearing strangers they met in the middle of the wilderness. Things generally go downhill from there, at least until the blue boxes start appearing. Delve is a story about finding your way in a new, strange, and dangerous world. It's about avoiding death, figuring out what the heck is going on, and trying to make some friends along the way. It's not about getting home, so much as finding a new one. Did I mention that there will be math?

### NEW SUMMARY (150-300 words)

Delve follows an ordinary man who awakens in an unfamiliar forest without explanation or apparent purpose. Unlike typical isekai narratives where characters are summoned for specific missions, this protagonist appears to have arrived by accident, with no clear goal or special destiny. He encounters a language barrier when meeting other people, complicating his attempts to understand his situation or communicate his needs. The story emphasizes the practical challenges of survival in an unknown environment, from basic needs like food and shelter to the social difficulties of being an outsider. The narrative introduces game-like systems through interface elements that appear to the protagonist, suggesting that this world operates according to rules similar to role-playing games, with levels, skills, and progression mechanics. The story focuses on the protagonist's gradual adaptation to this new reality, his efforts to learn the language and customs of the people he encounters, and his attempts to build relationships despite cultural and linguistic barriers. Themes of displacement, adaptation, and the search for belonging emerge as the protagonist realizes that returning home may not be possible and that he must instead find a way to exist in this new world. The narrative maintains a grounded, practical tone, emphasizing the day-to-day challenges of survival and integration rather than epic quests or world-saving missions.

## 20. World of Cultivation

**Book ID:** `f8486671-601d-4267-9347-8e859a7cc35a`  
**Author:** Fang Xiang  
**ISBN:** N/A  

### Original Description (for reference only)

> World of Cultivation is the tale of a disgruntled young man and his quest to be the best farmer he can be, at least if it wasn't for those annoying people who keep getting in the way of his pursuit of agricultural excellence. Will conspiring forces turn him into a sword cultivator, or will he manage to throw off the shackles of fate and grow the best darn crops in the sect? Those air-headed cultivators dream of too much nonsense and don't know how to live properly, they need to get a real job to earn some jingshi for a living like a normal person.

### NEW SUMMARY (150-300 words)

World of Cultivation follows a young man named Zuo Mo who initially aspires to focus on farming within a cultivation sect, prioritizing practical agriculture over the more traditional paths of martial and spiritual advancement. The story is set in a world where cultivation, the practice of increasing one's power and lifespan through various techniques, is the dominant social and cultural framework. Zuo Mo's perspective differs from typical cultivators, as he values mundane work and economic stability over the pursuit of immortality or martial prowess. However, circumstances repeatedly pull him away from his agricultural goals and into situations that require him to engage with cultivation practices despite his initial reluctance. The narrative explores the tension between personal desires and external pressures, as Zuo Mo finds himself drawn into conflicts and power struggles that challenge his attempt to live a simple, farming-focused life. The story examines how individuals navigate systems of power and expectation, and questions whether it's possible to maintain one's values when surrounded by forces that demand different priorities. Themes of pragmatism versus idealism emerge as Zuo Mo must balance his practical approach to life with the demands of the cultivation world around him. The narrative maintains a humorous tone while addressing serious questions about work, value, and personal agency within structured social systems.
