# Quick Start - Book Enrichment Workflow

## For New AI Agent Conversations

Use this **exact phrase** to start processing the next batch:

```
Process the next batch of 10 books for metadata enrichment following BATCH_ENRICHMENT_MASTER.md
```

That's it! The AI agent will handle everything automatically.

## What Happens Automatically

1. âœ… Reads all context files (AGENTS.md, WARP.md, enrichment guide, taxonomy)
2. âœ… Exports next 10 unenriched books from Neon database
3. âœ… Runs 8 enrichment tasks (covers, authors, taxonomy, etc.)
4. âœ… Generates summary worksheet
5. âœ… **Writes original 150-300 word summaries for all 10 books**
6. âœ… Imports summaries and regenerates SQL
7. âœ… Reviews taxonomy assignments
8. âœ… Executes SQL against Neon database
9. âœ… Creates batch report
10. âœ… Commits everything to Git

## Files You'll Get

**For batch NNN:**
- `books_batch_NNN.json` â€” Source data
- `enrichment_data/<book_id>.json` (x10) â€” Enrichment metadata
- `enrichment_sql/<book_id>.sql` (x10) â€” SQL migrations
- `batch_reports/batch_NNN_final_report.md` â€” Statistics
- `BATCH_NNN_COMPLETE.md` â€” Complete documentation

---

## Manual Steps (None Required!)

Everything is now automated, including summary writing. The AI agent will:
- Read book metadata and original descriptions
- Write completely original 150-300 word summaries
- Follow all quality guidelines (no spoilers, no marketing language)
- Validate word counts
- Import directly to enrichment data

## Current Status

| Batch | Books | Status | Imported | Date |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|------|
| 001   | 10    | âœ… Complete | âœ… Yes | 2025-10-23 |
| 002   | â€”     | ðŸ”„ Pending | â€” | â€” |

## Key Technical Notes

- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL (connection in `.env.local`)
- **Authors field:** TEXT[] array (use `ARRAY[]` syntax, not JSON)
- **SQL tool:** Node.js `pg` library (psql NOT installed)
- **All scripts:** Idempotent (safe to re-run)
