A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.<br><br>Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. <br><br>Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world.

    "new_summary": "Ender's Game follows Andrew Wiggin, a child selected by military authorities to train as a potential commander in humanity's ongoing conflict against an alien species. The story unfolds in a future where Earth faces repeated attacks from an alien race, and the military has developed a program to identify and train exceptionally gifted children in strategic warfare. Ender is separated from his family and sent to Battle School, an orbital training facility where children engage in simulated combat scenarios in zero gravity. The narrative explores themes of childhood manipulation, the psychological costs of military training, and the moral complexities of warfare. Ender struggles with isolation, the pressure to excel, and fears about his own capacity for violence as he navigates the competitive environment of Battle School. The novel examines how systems of power shape individuals and questions the boundaries between necessary preparation and psychological harm. Through Ender's experiences, the story probes the relationship between intelligence, empathy, and leadership, suggesting that the qualities that make an effective military commander may come at profound personal cost.",
